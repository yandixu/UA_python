Steps:
1.run buggy.py, 
(1).Lin32 been marked as invalid syntax
Debug: add ")" at the end of Lin30

(2).No file named voting.txt
Debug: Lines = file = open("votes.txt")

(3).Lin13: NameError: name 'lines' is not defined
Debug: Lines = Lines.split()

(4).Lin13: Lines = Lines.split()
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
Debug: delete Lin13,Lines has already a list.

add print(Lines) in Lin12 to check the list of Lines.

2.run buggy.py,
(1).In Lin16, change 16 to len(Lines)

(2).In Lin17, Name error
Debug: change lines to Lines

(3).Lin27: Name error
Debug: str(count/countAll)

3.run buggy.py,the output are:
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
percentage:0.0
Overall there were  0.0   yes votes

(1). only odd number lines will be used to calculate the vote percentage.
Debug: for m in range(1,len(Lines),2)

(2). the beginning of each output line should be the even number lines.
Debug: print(str(Lines[m-1].strip())+":",str((count/countAll)*100,1))

(3).the output number should times 100 and reserves a decimal fraction.
Debug: print(str(Lines[m-1].strip())+":",str(round((count/countAll)*100,1)))

4.add print(line) in Lin18 to check. The output are:
['yyynnnnynynyannnynynanynaanyna']
['nnnnynyynyanyaanynyanynnnanyna']
['nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnynnnnnynnnnny']
['nyyyyynyyNyyyyynynynyyYYnynynynyyynanyyna']
['aanynynynanyyynaaaanynynayynyynnnanynyn']
['nnyynynnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyayyYYY']
['nynynaaynynynnnnyyyAayyyynnnnnnnyannynyn']
['ynyyyyynyyyyyyay']

In split() method, the line will be split by each  blank space. 
There are no blank spaces in each line.

Debug:
(1).for m in range(1,len(Lines),2):
        line = Lines[m]
(2).use "words" to replace all "v" in code and change all elements to lower letter.
for words in line:
    if words.lower() == 'a':
        countAll += 1
    elif words.lower() == 'y':
        countAll += 1
        count += 1
    else:
        countAll += 1

5.
(1).Compare to the expected output, add print() in Lin28 out of the for loop.
(2).Lin29, the output number should times 100 and round to one decimal fraction. 
Debug: print("Overall there were ", round((count/countAll)*100,1),"  yes votes")

6.run buggy.py, the output are:
Aberdeenshire: 32.3
Midlothian: 30.6
Berwickshire: 22.9
Dunbartonshire: 33.3
Fife: 33.7
Lanarkshire: 37.7
East Lothian: 37.5
Ayrshire: 40.0

Overall there were  40.0   yes votes

(1).count and countAll should be accumulate from each line and return to 0 when come to next line.
There should be another "countTotal" and "countAllTotal" accumulate for the sum of yes votes and
countAll from each line. 
Debug: 
    countTotal = 0
    countAllTotal = 0
    for m in range(1,len(Lines),2):
        line = Lines[m].strip()
        count = 0
        countAll = 0
        for words in line:
            if words.lower() == 'a':
                countAll += 1
            elif words.lower() == 'y':
                countAll += 1
                count += 1
            else:
                countAll += 1
        countTotal += count
        countAllTotal += countAll

        print(str(Lines[m-1].strip())+":",str(round((count/countAll)*100,1)))
    print()
    print("Overall there were ", round((countTotal/countAllTotal)*100,1),"yes votes")
